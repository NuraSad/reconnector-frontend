# Team Fantastic Four (now five!): Reconnect

## Introduction
<p>Having common interests can create empathy and understanding between co-workers. As companies go remote giving employees more freedom it can remove the a companyâ€™s culture by not giving the opportunity for co-workers to find common interests outside of work.</p>
<p>Our app helps to build that bridge. We want to repair those bonds of common interest but also bring a sense of company pride and gamification to it.
As companies take the step towards going fully remote, employees can lose the banter and kinship.  With our app you can share events with other employees and compete against other companies for points</p>
